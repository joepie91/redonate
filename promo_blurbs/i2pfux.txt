I2Pfux is a 100% compatible fork of I2P, software that puts privacy and anonymity center stage in the fight against the ongoing erosion of civil liberties. If you're an activist, a whistleblower, or just someone who cares about civil liberties, I2Pfux is for you! With anonymous e-mail, torrenting, chat and webserving built in, and with the option to run pretty much most services that exist on the normal net, it's a comprehensive communication solution for those that don't take kindly to their private business being infringed upon!
