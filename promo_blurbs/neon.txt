Neon is an open source multilevel and multiuser website control panel based on nginx, MySQL and PHP. In essence Neon, once installed on a server, will allow an administrator to create and manage user accounts. Those user accounts will each be assigned a private file structure and will be able to manage their own domains, DNS, email, MySQL databases and backups. Neon is based on PHP and comes with an automated installer that turns a blank server into a fully configured webserver, including Exim or Postfix, Bind or PowerDNS, and ProFTPd or PureFTPd, depending on preference. Neon is currently in development.
