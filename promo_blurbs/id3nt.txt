Id3nt is a censorship-resistant microblogging service exclusive to the I2P network, a Twitter for cryptoanarchists, whistleblowers, those under the yoke of oppressive regimes, and privacy-loving users everywhere. With a voting system and a soon-to-be-launched privilege feature, Id3nt encourages positive contributions, incentivizing information sharing and a frank and unguarded exchange of views.  With no identifiable location, no hosting service to approach, subpoenas and takedown requests are about as effective as a chocolate fireguard! Bulletproof yourself today, get on the I2P network and id3ntify yourself!
