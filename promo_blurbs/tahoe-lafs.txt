Our goal is a decentralized and censorship-resistant Web; a Web that can't be surveilled or censored, a Web with no master. Our contribution to that goal is Tahoe-LAFS, a Free and Open cloud storage system. It distributes your data across multiple servers, so that even if some of them fail or are taken over by an attacker, the storage system continues to function correctly without compromising your privacy or security.
